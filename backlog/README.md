AS a potential disaster victim,  I´d like to ask for help, by sending my position and my health condition, personal information (name, cell phone number …), and receive the feedback that they were given.   So I can be sure that my helpers can find me.

As an Agency Operator, I´d like to know, in real time, the people's position,  personal information (name, cell phone number …)  and condition and forward it to the rescue team and track the situation of each of them. So we can control each rescue mission and try to elaborate a list of potential victims.
